# spring-boot-actuator-custom
## Introduction
The Spring Boot Actuator, It provides several built-in endpoints and capabilities for monitoring and interacting with our application at runtime. For exampleÂ 

`Health Endpoint`: It exposes information about the application's health, indicating whether the application is functioning correctly.

`Info Endpoint`: It provides custom information about the application, allowing you to expose arbitrary details such as version numbers, build information, etc.

`Metrics Endpoint`: It exposes a variety of metrics related to the application's performance, such as memory usage, garbage collection stats, and custom metrics.

or even create custom endpoints to expose additional information that we want, depending on our requirements. And, in this article, I'm going to provide some examples of custom endpoints and the important configuration that you need to know when working with actuators.


## Built-in Endpoints
The built-in endpoints are the endpoints that Spring Boot already provides for you. It's going to capture serveral aspects of information about your application for monitoring. To use built-in endpoints, it is straight-forward. You just need to define the endpoint that you want to expose in the `application. propertis` with the tag below.

`management.endpoints.web.exposure.include = endpointName1, endpointName2 `\
and\
`management.endpoint.health.show-details=always`  (Provided details are shown to all users.)

For the lists of endpoints available, please see at -> [Actuator endpoints](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/actuator.html#actuator.endpoints)

Once you've done the setup of the above configuration, run the application and navigate to the endpoint `http://localhost:8080/actuator`. It's going to provide all the available endpoints that you can access in the illustration below.

## Custom Endpoints
To custom endpoint, it' require coding for custom meet specific requirement, So I'm going to provide 3 example custom endpoint for health checking at following 
* Checks for low disk space.
* Checks that a connection to DataSource can be obtained.
* Ping target service

For custom endpoint configuration, we have to declare the class as bean, and the path for access will be align with the bean name. Please look at more details in the example below.

### Checks for low disk space.
 ```java
@Component("disk")
public class CheckDiskSpaceHealthIndicator implements HealthIndicator {
    private DiskSpaceHealthIndicator disk;
    private String path;
    private int threshold;

    @Value("${custom.actuator.disk.path}")
    public void setPath(String path) {
        this.path = path;
    }

    @Value("${custom.actuator.disk.threshold.gb}")
    public void setThreshold(int threshold) {
        this.threshold = threshold;
    }

    @Override
    public Health health() {
        try {
            this.disk = new DiskSpaceHealthIndicator(new File(path), DataSize.ofGigabytes(threshold));
            Health originalHealth = disk.health();
            if (originalHealth.getStatus().equals(Status.UP)) {
                return Health.up().withDetail("details", originalHealth.getDetails()).build();
            } else {
                return Health.down().withDetail("error", originalHealth.getDetails()).build();
            }
        } catch (Exception e) {
            return Health.down().withDetail("error", "Failed to check disk space").build();
        }
    }
}
 ```
